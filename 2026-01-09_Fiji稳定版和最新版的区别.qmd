## 1. Fiji有稳定版和最新版之别

当下载Fiji [@Schindelin2012]时，会发现有两个版本的Fiji：稳定版（STABLE）和最新版（LATEST）。

## 2. 两个版本的区别

如上图所示，以及如Odinsbane所说[@Jrbr]：

> Fiji-latest will include more recent versions of core libraries and uses java 21. Fiji-stable targets java 8.

或者如Curtis Rueden所说[@Jrbr]：

> Fiji-Latest bundles Java 21 ... Fiji-Latest (compared to Fiji-stable) generally prunes Fiji a bit to remove various obsolete no-longer-functional things.

> ...the two Fijis (latest and stable) are still [close enough]{.mark} together that [targeting Fiji-Stable means your plugin also works on Fiji-Latest]{.mark}. But that will [not remain the case forever]{.mark}: ***as Fiji-Latest continues to move forward, eventually plugin authors may need to choose whether to keep supporting Stable (i.e. stay with Java 8) or jump to Latest only***.

## 3. Fiji-stable的最终命运

同样如Curtis Rueden所说[@Jrbr]：

> My plan for [Q1 2026 is to finally enable the Fiji-Stable-to-Fiji-Latest migration tool]{.mark} that is already built into the Updater, but which is disabled by default to avoid breaking people's Fiji-Stable installations.

> [Once]{.mark} this migrator is working well for the vast majority of users, [we can discontinue Fiji-Stable as a top-level download]{.mark}—i.e. move it into the "More downloads" area and label it as a historical version that is no longer updated.

感觉可能的话，还是下载和使用Fiji-latest。

## 4. 为什么Fiji-stable有两个启动文件

```
# Windows版本下的启动文件。

# Fiji-stable的启动文件
├── fiji-windows-x64.exe
└── ImageJ-win64.exe

# Fiji-latest的启动文件
└── fiji-windows-x64.exe
```

能够看出来，Fiji-stable有两个.exe启动文件（launchers），分别是fiji-windows-x64.exe和ImageJ-win64.exe，这是为什么？

如Odinsbane所说[@Jrbr]：

> The two launchers are two different ways to start fiji. <mark>fiji-windows-x64.exe is the shiny new launcher based on jaunch</mark>. It uses a different set of config files compared to the old/legacy launcher ImageJ-win64.exe. <mark>You shouldn't notice a difference based on how you start fiji</mark>, except you could have different configurations.

> Both launchers will start fiji, and load plugins that you've installed. Ideally <mark>they should both be the same</mark>. In some cases the new launcher doesn't work. For example, I cannot use the Jaunch based launcher on Rocky 8 because GLIBC is too old.

> If you're using the default locations for plugins, then yes <mark>both launchers should load the same plugins</mark>.

如Curtis Rueden所说[@Jrbr]：

> the fiji-\*-\* launcher is the current one, built on Jaunch. It is a complete redesign of the old ImageJ launcher to better support Java 9+. The ImageJ-\* launcher is the old one, kept in Fiji-Stable in case the new launcher fails to work on your system. <mark>If fiji-\*-\* is working, use that one</mark>.

所以，默认下就用fiji-\*-\* launcher启动Fiji。
